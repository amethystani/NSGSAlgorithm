\begin{abstract}
Image segmentation remains a computationally intensive task, particularly challenging for real-time applications on resource-constrained platforms. Conventional methods, often relying on synchronous, iterative updates across the entire image grid, face bottlenecks in parallelization efficiency and struggle with heterogeneous compute environments. This paper introduces Neuro-Scheduling for Graph Segmentation (NSGS), a novel image segmentation framework inspired by neuromorphic computing principles. NSGS models image regions as computational units (analogous to neurons) that communicate asynchronously via events ("spikes") triggered by local state changes exceeding adaptive thresholds. This event-driven paradigm facilitates inherent parallelism with minimal synchronization overhead, dynamically focusing computation on information-rich areas. We demonstrate that NSGS achieves significant speedups (1.5-2.2x) over traditional parallel approaches while maintaining comparable segmentation accuracy (measured by mIoU and Boundary F1 score). Furthermore, NSGS exhibits adaptive resource management, dynamically adjusting computational intensity based on system load and thermal constraints, making it suitable for diverse hardware platforms. We evaluate NSGS scalability and robustness across multiple devices and datasets, highlighting its potential for efficient, real-time image processing.

\section{Introduction}
Image segmentation, the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments or sets of pixels, is a cornerstone of computer vision, enabling higher-level tasks such as object recognition, scene understanding, and autonomous navigation \cite{Haralick1985}. Despite significant advancements, particularly with deep learning \cite{Minaee2021, Long2015, Ronneberger2015}, the computational demands of accurate segmentation often hinder real-time performance, especially on mobile or embedded systems with limited power and thermal budgets.

Traditional segmentation algorithms, including graph-based methods like normalized cuts \cite{Shi2000} or iterative optimization techniques, typically involve processing the entire image grid synchronously in each step. While amenable to certain forms of parallelization (e.g., data parallelism), these approaches often encounter challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Synchronization Overhead:} Coordinating updates across parallel processing units introduces significant latency.
    \item \textbf{Load Imbalance:} Computationally intensive regions can bottleneck overall processing speed.
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Resource Utilization:} Homogeneous image regions may undergo unnecessary computation.
    \item \textbf{Heterogeneity Challenges:} Effectively utilizing diverse compute resources (CPU, GPU, NPU) remains complex \cite{Christensen2022}.
\end{itemize}

Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the structure and function of the biological brain, offers an alternative computational paradigm \cite{Mead1990, Davies2018, Akopyan2015}. Its principles of massive parallelism, asynchronous event-based communication ("spikes"), and co-located memory and processing hold promise for overcoming the limitations of conventional architectures, particularly for tasks involving spatio-temporal pattern processing.

In this paper, we propose Neuro-Scheduling for Graph Segmentation (NSGS), an image segmentation framework that leverages neuromorphic principles to achieve efficient, parallel, and adaptive processing. NSGS conceptualizes image segmentation not as a synchronous iteration, but as the emergent behavior of a network of asynchronous processing elements communicating through discrete events. Each element represents an image region, and its activation ("firing") is determined by local image features and the state of its neighbors, mediated by adaptive thresholds. This event-driven approach naturally focuses computation on areas of change and complexity, minimizing redundant processing and synchronization.

\section{Related Work} \label{sec:related_work}
Image segmentation methodologies have evolved along two parallel tracks: graph-based algorithms for their theoretical elegance and parallel computing adaptations to meet real-time demands. Recent neuromorphic advances further disrupt this landscape by rethinking computation itself. We contextualize NSGS within these paradigms.

\subsection{Graph-Based Segmentation Foundations}
The seminal work of Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher \cite{Felzenszwalb2004} established graph-based segmentation as a gold standard. Their algorithm constructs a graph where pixels are nodes connected by edges weighted with color dissimilarity. Using Kruskal's algorithm, it iteratively merges regions based on an adaptive predicate:

\begin{equation}
D(C_1, C_2) = 
\begin{cases}
\text{True} & \text{if } \text{Dif}(C_1, C_2) > MInt(C_1, C_2) \\
\text{False} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $MInt(C_1, C_2) = \min(Int(C_1) + \tau(C_1), Int(C_2) + \tau(C_2))$
    \item $Int(C)$ is the maximum edge weight in a region's MST
    \item $Dif(C_1, C_2)$ is the minimum inter-region edge weight
    \item $\tau(C) = k/|C|$ penalizes small regions
\end{itemize}

While achieving $O(n\log n)$ complexity, their method is inherently sequential, merging regions greedily without leveraging modern parallel architectures.

\subsection{Parallel Adaptations of Graph Methods}
Efforts to parallelize graph-based segmentation face intrinsic challenges due to dependency chains in region merging. Saglam and Baykan \cite{Saglam2016} parallelized a Borůvka-inspired hierarchical MST algorithm using OpenMP. Their approach partitions the image graph, processes subgraphs concurrently, and merges results with lock-free queues. While reporting 1.5–2× speedups on quad-core CPUs, their work inherits Amdahl's law limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Synchronization bottlenecks:} Global barriers after each merging phase limit scalability.
    \item \textbf{Load imbalance:} Irregular graph structures (e.g., high-texture regions) cause thread underutilization.
    \item \textbf{Memory contention:} Concurrent writes to shared edge queues degrade performance on NUMA architectures.
\end{itemize}

Dezső et al. \cite{Dezso2012} empirically compared graph methods on satellite imagery, finding normalized cuts \cite{Shi2000} superior for boundary accuracy but 4–6× slower than Felzenszwalb's method. Their work highlighted a critical trade-off: top-down methods (e.g., normalized cuts) preserve global structure but scale poorly ($O(n^3)$ for eigen decomposition), while bottom-up methods (e.g., Felzenszwalb) are efficient but sensitive to local minima.

\subsection{Neuromorphic and Event-Driven Vision}
Neuromorphic computing reimagines computation through biological principles: sparse events ("spikes"), asynchronous communication, and co-located memory-processor units. While prior work applied spiking neural networks (SNNs) to pixel-wise segmentation \cite{Maass1997, Ha2016, Bartolozzi2022}, these approaches lack explicit graph structures to model region adjacency—a strength of graph-based methods. NSGS bridges this gap by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unifying graph topology with event-driven processing:} Regions (graph nodes) asynchronously exchange state changes via spikes, avoiding global synchronization.
    \item \textbf{Dynamic resource allocation:} Adaptive firing thresholds ($\theta_v$) focus computation on unstable regions (e.g., boundaries), unlike OpenMP's static work partitioning.
    \item \textbf{Inherent scalability:} Decentralized event queues naturally map to distributed systems, contrasting with centralized schedulers in \cite{Saglam2016}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Positioning of NSGS}
NSGS synthesizes the theoretical rigor of graph-based methods with neuromorphic efficiency. Unlike Felzenszwalb's sequential merging or Saglam's rigid OpenMP parallelization, NSGS exploits locality of reference: regions only communicate when local gradients exceed thresholds (Fig. \ref{fig:spike-dynamics}). This aligns with findings from Dezső et al. \cite{Dezso2012}, where top-down methods suffered from excessive computation in homogeneous regions. By dynamically suppressing events in stable areas (e.g., $\text{Dif}(C_1, C_2) \ll \theta_v$), NSGS reduces redundant computation by 38–62\% compared to OpenMP baselines (Table \ref{tab:graph-comparison}).

Neuromorphic computing offers an alternative paradigm, emphasizing event-driven processing and sparse communication. While prior neuromorphic vision research focused on spiking neural networks \cite{Maass1997, Merolla2014, Muir2025}, few have applied these principles to graph-based segmentation. NSGS bridges this gap by reimagining segmentation as an emergent property of asynchronous processing elements, avoiding global synchronization and enabling dynamic load balancing—advances not achievable with OpenMP or conventional graph frameworks \cite{Bartolozzi2022}.

\section{Methodology} \label{sec:methodology}
The NSGS framework reconceptualizes image segmentation as a dynamic, event-driven process unfolding on a graph representation of the image. This section details the core components and operational principles of the NSGS algorithm, followed by our specific implementation approach.

\subsection{Conceptual Model: Event-Driven Graph Processing}

Instead of iterating over pixels, NSGS operates on a graph \(G = (V, E)\), where nodes \(v \in V\) represent local image regions (e.g., superpixels or fixed blocks) and edges \(e \in E\) represent spatial adjacency and feature similarity between regions. Each node \(v\) acts as a \textit{Processing Element (PE)} inspired by spiking neuron models.

Key properties of a PE \(v\):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Internal State (\(S_v\)):} Represents the current segmentation label or state associated with the region.
    \item \textbf{Membrane Potential (\(P_v\)):} An internal variable accumulating evidence or "charge" based on incoming events (spikes) from neighboring PEs and local feature analysis. \(P_v\) typically reflects the confidence or consistency of the current state \(S_v\).
    \item \textbf{Firing Threshold (\(\theta_v\)):} An adaptive threshold. When \(P_v\) exceeds \(\theta_v\), the PE "fires," generating an outgoing event (spike).
    \item \textbf{Refractory Period:} A brief period after firing during which the PE cannot fire again, preventing immediate re-activation and stabilizing dynamics.
    \item \textbf{Connections:} Weighted connections to adjacent PEs \(u \in \text{Neighbors}(v)\). Connection weights \(w_{uv}\) typically depend on the feature similarity (color, texture, gradients) between regions \(u\) and \(v\). Stronger weights facilitate event propagation between similar regions.
\end{itemize}

Segmentation emerges from the propagation of state information via these events. When a PE \(v\) fires, it sends events to its neighbors \(u\). These events increment or modify the potential \(P_u\) of the receiving PEs. If a neighbor \(u\) receives sufficient input to cross its own threshold \(\theta_u\), it too may fire, potentially updating its state \(S_u\) based on the incoming information and propagating the change further. Segmentation boundaries naturally form along paths where event propagation is weak or inconsistent due to significant feature dissimilarities (low connection weights).

\subsection{Algorithm Overview}

While the system operates asynchronously, the conceptual flow can be outlined as follows (see Algorithm \ref{alg:nsgs}):

These statistics represent the measured computational characteristics of NSGS when processing our test datasets. The values were collected from 87 experimental runs across various image sizes and complexities.

\subsection{From Theory to Implementation}
The abstract model described above has been implemented as a practical system for image segmentation. Our implementation translates the theoretical concepts into executable code, with careful consideration of real-world constraints and optimization opportunities. The implementation spans both the algorithmic layer (C++ core) and system integration layer (hardware-specific optimizations).

The NSGS implementation uses the following technology stack:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Core Algorithm:} C++17 with custom thread management and lock-free data structures
    \item \textbf{Image Processing:} OpenCV 4.5.4 for initial feature extraction and final visualization
    \item \textbf{Parallel Computing:} Custom event scheduler with work-stealing queue implemented using atomic operations
    \item \textbf{Hardware Acceleration:} SIMD vectorization (AVX2/NEON) for feature computation and Metal/OpenCL for heterogeneous computing on mobile devices
    \item \textbf{Profiling:} Custom instrumentation framework capturing the metrics presented in Table \ref{tab:neural-statistics}
\end{itemize}

Performance characteristics presented in this paper reflect measurements from this concrete implementation, not theoretical projections. As shown in our results section, the implemented system achieves substantial performance improvements over traditional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy.

\subsubsection{Critical Implementation Specifics}
The following implementation details are crucial for reproducing our results:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Graph Construction:} We use SLIC superpixels \cite{Achanta2012} as the basis for our PE graph, with a mean of 352 nodes per image. Initial segmentation is generated using standard watershed segmentation to establish baseline regions.
    
    \item \textbf{Event Queue Implementation:} Our lock-free queue uses a combination of array-based ring buffers for local thread queues and a global work-stealing mechanism based on Chase-Lev deque \cite{Chase2005}. Queue operations have an empirical worst-case latency of 0.38μs on our test hardware.
    
    \item \textbf{SIMD Optimizations:} Feature extraction and potential updates for PEs use manually vectorized code (SSE4.2/AVX2 on x86, NEON on ARM) with explicit memory alignment, yielding a 2.34× speedup for these operations compared to scalar code.
    
    \item \textbf{Memory Model:} We employed a custom memory allocator that pre-allocates pools of fixed-size objects (PEs, events, etc.) to minimize runtime allocation overhead and improve cache locality \cite{Akopyan2015}.
\end{itemize}

The full implementation, including configuration parameters and benchmark scripts, is available at the repository link provided in Section \ref{sec:results}.

\subsection{Parallelization Strategy and Implementation Details}

NSGS employs multiple levels of parallelism and specific techniques to maximize efficiency.

\subsubsection{Hierarchical Parallelism}
As mentioned in the Introduction, NSGS utilizes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pipeline Parallelism:} The stages (Feature Extraction, Graph Construction, Event Propagation, Reconstruction) can operate as a pipeline, especially beneficial for video processing where stages can overlap across frames.
    \item \textbf{Data Parallelism:} The graph \(G\) can be spatially partitioned. Each partition is assigned to a primary processing unit (e.g., a CPU core or GPU stream processor). Events within a partition are handled locally. Events crossing partition boundaries require communication.
    \item \textbf{Instruction-Level Parallelism (SIMD):} Operations within feature extraction and potentially within event processing (e.g., updating potentials for multiple neighbors simultaneously) can be vectorized using SIMD instructions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Minimal Synchronization Architecture} \label{subsubsec:sync_architecture}
Minimizing synchronization is crucial for performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lock-Free Event Queue:} Using atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) operations for enqueueing and dequeueing events avoids traditional locks, reducing contention and latency, especially with many worker threads \cite{Chase2005}.
    \item \textbf{Boundary Exchange Protocol:} For data parallelism across partitions, communication is often restricted to PEs on partition boundaries. This exchange can happen periodically or asynchronously, rather than requiring global barriers.
    \item \textbf{Relaxed Consistency:} The event-driven nature allows for some tolerance to minor inconsistencies. A PE might briefly operate on slightly stale information from a neighbor, but the system tends to converge correctly due to the continuous flow of updates. This avoids strict consistency checks that would impose synchronization overhead.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Thread Management and Work Distribution} \label{subsubsec:thread_management}
Efficient use of processing cores relies on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Worker Thread Pool:} A fixed or adaptive pool of threads processes events from the main queue or local queues (if partitioned).
    \item \textbf{Work Stealing:} If using local queues per thread/core, idle threads can "steal" events from busy threads' queues to improve load balancing, particularly effective for images with uneven complexity \cite{Chase2005}.
    \item \textbf{Priority Scheduling:} Events can be prioritized (e.g., events originating from PEs near strong edges, or events representing significant state changes) to guide the segmentation process more quickly towards convergence.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dynamic Resource Management} \label{subsubsec:dynamic_resource}
Adaptability is key for deployment on diverse hardware:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Thermal-Aware Thresholding:} The Load Balancing Controller monitors system temperature or load indicators. If load/temperature exceeds limits, it increases the firing thresholds (\(\theta_v\)) globally or in active regions. Higher thresholds mean PEs require more evidence to fire, reducing the overall number of events and thus computational load (Figure \ref{fig:threshold-adaptation}) \cite{Muir2025}.
    \item \textbf{Workload Prediction:} Simple image complexity metrics (e.g., edge density, texture variance) calculated during feature extraction can predict the likely event load, allowing the controller to set initial thresholds proactively.
    \item \textbf{Graceful Degradation:} Instead of simply running slower under heavy load, increasing thresholds provides a trade-off: slightly less detailed segmentation refinement (as fewer subtle events propagate) in exchange for maintaining real-time performance \cite{Christensen2022}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Heterogeneous Computing Integration}

NSGS is designed for heterogeneous platforms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Task Partitioning:} Different stages or graph partitions can be assigned to CPU cores, GPU compute units, or specialized accelerators (NPUs) based on suitability \cite{Davies2018}. Feature extraction might map well to GPUs or NPUs, while the irregular memory access patterns of event processing might favor CPUs, or partitioned graphs could run on multiple GPU streams.
    \item \textbf{Memory Optimization:} Careful management of data placement and minimizing data transfers between different processor memories (e.g., system RAM and GPU VRAM) is critical. The localized nature of event processing can help improve cache locality.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration with Deep Learning Models} \label{subsec:dl_integration}

NSGS can operate standalone using traditional features or synergistically with deep learning models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deep Feature Seeding:} Instead of basic color/texture features, the graph constructor can use rich semantic features or initial segmentation probability maps generated by a CNN (e.g., YOLOv8, U-Net \cite{Ronneberger2015}). Connection weights \(w_{uv}\) can be based on feature vector similarity in the embedding space \cite{Hinton2006}.
    \item \textbf{Boundary Refinement:} The CNN provides a strong initial segmentation. NSGS then refines this segmentation, particularly focusing its event-driven processing near uncertain boundaries or small object details where CNNs might struggle \cite{Wang2020, Lin2022}, leveraging the spatial graph structure.
    \item \textbf{Iterative Feedback:} In video processing, the segmentation output from NSGS for frame \(t\) can potentially inform or guide the feature extraction process (e.g., attention mechanisms) in the CNN for frame \(t+1\) \cite{Chen2021, Sun2019}.
\end{itemize}
This hybrid approach aims to combine the semantic understanding and accuracy of deep models with the parallel efficiency and boundary refinement capabilities of the event-driven NSGS core.

\subsection{Baseline Methods for Comparison}

NSGS performance was compared against:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{YOLOv8 Segmentation:} Representative state-of-the-art deep learning baseline (using official implementation or standard framework).
    \item \textbf{Mobile SAM:} Lightweight version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) optimized for mobile devices.
    \item \textbf{Parallel Normalized Cuts:} A traditional graph-based method adapted for parallel execution. % Made more specific
    \item \textbf{Synchronous Parallel Tiling:} A baseline parallel implementation that divides the image into tiles and processes them synchronously.
    % \item Cloud-offloaded segmentation (Removed unless specifically compared)
\end{itemize}
For fair comparison, baselines were optimized for the respective hardware platforms where feasible.

\section{Results and Discussion} \label{sec:results}

\subsection{Benchmark Datasets and Evaluation Protocol}
To ensure a fair and comprehensive evaluation of NSGS against state-of-the-art methods, we utilized multiple benchmark datasets widely accepted in the image segmentation literature:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cityscapes} \cite{Cordts2016}: A large-scale dataset containing high-resolution urban street scenes from 50 different cities with pixel-level annotations across 30 classes. We used the validation set (500 images) for our primary benchmarks.
    
    \item \textbf{PASCAL VOC 2012} \cite{Everingham2015}: A widely-used dataset containing 21 object categories with pixel-wise annotations. We used the augmented training set (10,582 images) for training baseline models and the validation set (1,449 images) for evaluation.
    
    \item \textbf{COCO-Stuff} \cite{Caesar2018}: Provides detailed annotations for 91 thing categories and 91 stuff categories. We used a subset of 5,000 images from the validation set for our experiments.
    
    \item \textbf{ADE20K} \cite{Zhou2019}: A densely annotated dataset covering a diverse range of scenes with 150 semantic categories. We used the validation set (2,000 images) for benchmarking.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, we collected and annotated our own dataset of 2,500 images focused on challenging real-world scenarios with varied lighting conditions, occlusions, and complex boundaries. This dataset, which we call NeuroBoundary, complements existing benchmarks by providing examples specifically designed to test boundary refinement capabilities and computational efficiency under resource constraints. It includes images captured on mobile devices in indoor/outdoor environments with varying complexity levels.

These datasets collectively provide a comprehensive evaluation suite that aligns with contemporary literature in the field. Recent work by Minaee et al. \cite{Minaee2021} and Chen et al. \cite{Chen2021} follows similar evaluation protocols across multiple datasets, enabling direct comparison with published state-of-the-art results.

For all experiments, we report standard metrics including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Boundary F1 score (BF), and execution time. Performance values were averaged over 5 runs to ensure statistical reliability. For mobile device testing, we controlled ambient temperature (23±1°C) and battery level (70-90\%) to minimize performance variations.

\subsection{Comparison with Graph-Based Baselines}
To contextualize NSGS's performance, we evaluated against two graph-based baselines: Felzenszwalb's algorithm \cite{Felzenszwalb2004} and its OpenMP-parallelized variant \cite{Saglam2016}. As shown in Table \ref{tab:graph-comparison}, NSGS achieves a 1.8× speedup over the OpenMP implementation on the Cityscapes dataset while maintaining comparable mIoU (72.1 vs. 71.8). This gain stems from reduced synchronization: NSGS requires only 4 global coordination points per frame versus 12 in OpenMP. Felzenszwalb's original serial implementation, while lightweight (peak memory: 420MB), fails to meet real-time thresholds (2.1s/frame).

\end{figure}

The performance analysis comparing NSGS with YOLOv8 and Mobile SAM segmentation revealed significant efficiency improvements across multiple dimensions. Based on our experimental data collected from processing 87 different images:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Execution Time:} NSGS consistently achieved processing times of 1000-2000ms compared to YOLOv8's 9000-11000ms and Mobile SAM's 7000-8000ms for the same images, representing a 4-5× speedup over YOLOv8 and 3.5-4× over Mobile SAM.
    
    \item \textbf{Output Quality:} Visual inspection of the output images showed comparable segmentation quality between NSGS and both standard baselines, with NSGS sometimes producing cleaner object boundaries.
    
    \item \textbf{Processing Pipeline:} As shown in Figure \ref{fig:performance-comparison}, NSGS achieved faster processing in all stages, with the most dramatic improvement in the Event Propagation/Inference stage compared to both YOLOv8 and Mobile SAM.
    
    \item \textbf{Resource Utilization:} NSGS maintained lower CPU utilization while providing responsive performance, making it suitable for mobile devices with thermal constraints. Mobile SAM, while more efficient than YOLOv8, still exhibited higher resource consumption than NSGS.
    
    \item \textbf{Parallelization:} With an average of 5 parallel pathways and 6 levels of parallelization depth, NSGS effectively leveraged concurrent processing to achieve its performance advantages over both baseline models.
\end{itemize}

The neural processing characteristics of NSGS directly contribute to these performance improvements. The average of 534 neural spikes per processing run with a transmission rate of 0.48 demonstrates the algorithm's ability to focus computation on informative regions while suppressing redundant calculations. Thread utilization of 79.2% and load balancing efficiency of 90.1% highlight the effectiveness of the work distribution strategy.

\subsection{Statistical Validation of Results}
To ensure the statistical significance of our performance claims, we conducted rigorous validation across multiple runs. Table \ref{tab:statistical-validation} presents a detailed statistical analysis of our key performance metrics.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The p-values were determined through paired t-tests comparing NSGS against the baseline methods (YOLOv8 and Mobile SAM). All reported improvements are statistically significant (p < 0.05). Effect sizes (Cohen's d) indicate moderate to large practical significance for all metrics. Energy consumption measurements were collected using platform-specific APIs (PowerMetrics on iOS, Battery Historian on Android) with ambient temperature controlled at 23±1°C.

Figure \ref{fig:visual-comparison} presents a visual comparison of segmentation outputs between NSGS, YOLOv8, and Mobile SAM. While all three methods produce visually comparable results for most image regions, NSGS demonstrates improved boundary precision in areas with fine details or gradual transitions (highlighted in red in the figure).

\section{Limitations and Future Work} \label{sec:limitations}
While NSGS demonstrates promising results, several limitations and challenges should be acknowledged:

\subsection{Current Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Parameter Sensitivity:} NSGS performance is sensitive to initial threshold settings ($\theta_v$). Inappropriate values can lead to either excessive event generation (computational waste) or insufficient region refinement (accuracy loss). Our current heuristic approach requires careful tuning for each new hardware platform \cite{Christensen2022}.
    
    
    \item \textbf{Performance on Complex Scenes:} For extremely complex scenes with many small objects and intricate boundaries, the advantage of NSGS over traditional methods diminishes to approximately 1.2× speedup vs. 4-5× for typical scenes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Failure Cases}
In our experimental evaluation, we identified specific conditions where NSGS underperforms:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Images with very low contrast boundaries show degraded segmentation quality (average 8.3\% reduction in Boundary F1 score).
    
    \item Highly textured regions occasionally lead to over-segmentation, though this can be mitigated by adjusting the threshold parameters.
    
    \item Sudden thermal throttling on mobile devices can cause uneven performance if the adaptive threshold mechanism cannot react quickly enough \cite{Bartolozzi2022}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Directions}
Based on these limitations, we identify several promising directions for future work:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Formal Convergence Analysis:} Developing mathematical guarantees for convergence under defined conditions \cite{Hochreiter1997}.
    
    \item \textbf{Hardware Co-Design:} Exploring custom hardware accelerators specifically designed for event-driven graph processing \cite{He2016, Fukushima1980, Akopyan2015}.
    
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Deep Learning Integration:} Tighter coupling between CNN-based semantic features and NSGS refinement, potentially using learnable parameters for event generation and propagation \cite{Lin2022, Wang2020}.
    
    \item \textbf{Temporal Consistency:} Extending NSGS to video segmentation by incorporating temporal edges in the graph structure to maintain consistency across frames.
    
    \item \textbf{Distributed Implementation:} Scaling NSGS to distributed systems for processing extremely large images or real-time video streams across networked devices.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced the Neural Spike-based Graph Segmentation (NSGS) approach, which reimagines image segmentation through neuromorphic computing principles. Our work addresses the limitations of conventional synchronous, grid-based approaches by implementing an event-driven, minimally synchronized computational model.

The experimental results demonstrate that NSGS offers significant advantages over traditional approaches like YOLOv8 and Mobile SAM:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Execution Time Efficiency:} NSGS consistently achieved faster processing times (1000-2000ms) compared to YOLOv8 (9000-11000ms) and Mobile SAM (7000-8000ms) across comparable image sizes, representing a 4-5× speedup over YOLOv8 and 3.5-4× over Mobile SAM.
    
    \item \textbf{Resource Utilization:} NSGS demonstrated superior memory efficiency and lower CPU utilization compared to traditional approaches. This efficiency stems from the event-driven architecture that allocates computational resources only when needed \cite{Merolla2014}.
    
    \item \textbf{Concurrent Processing:} The parallel pathways (typically 4-5) and high thread utilization (averaging 79.2\%) in NSGS enable effective concurrent execution across heterogeneous computing environments, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:concurrency_metrics}.
    
    \item \textbf{Minimal Synchronization:} With only 4 synchronization points compared to traditional approaches requiring lock-step synchronization, NSGS reduces coordination overhead.
    
    \item \textbf{Processing Pipeline Efficiency:} NSGS demonstrates a more balanced distribution between preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing compared to both YOLOv8 and Mobile SAM, where inference dominates the execution time.
\end{itemize}

These findings have significant implications for resource-constrained and heterogeneous computing environments, where traditional segmentation approaches face substantial limitations. The event-driven, spike-based communication model of NSGS enables adaptive resource allocation that scales efficiently across varying computational landscapes.

Future work will focus on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Further optimizing the neural graph topology to increase branch prediction accuracy and reduce critical path length
    \item Exploring hardware co-design opportunities that leverage the inherent parallelism of NSGS
    \item Extending the approach to 3D segmentation and temporal data
    \item Implementing adaptive mechanisms to dynamically adjust parallelization depth based on available resources
\end{itemize}

The NSGS approach represents a significant shift in how we conceptualize image segmentation algorithms, drawing inspiration from biological neural systems to create more efficient, adaptive, and scalable solutions.
